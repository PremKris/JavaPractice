1)	Check whether an element is present in an array or not (linear search):

	Problem: We're given an array of numbers and a specific number called the "target." Our task is to determine whether this target number is present within our array or not.

	Approach: Here's a simple way we could solve this problem. We'll start at the beginning of our array and check each element one by one to see if it's the same as our target number.
	
	This process is known as linear search - think of it as taking a magnifying glass and going down the line of our array, examining each number closely. 
	
	If we find a match, we can immediately say that the target is indeed present in the array. If we get to the end of the array without finding the target, 
	
	then it's safe to say the target is not present in the array.

	public class ArraySearch

	{

	public static void main(String[] args)

	{

	//Complete code here

	}

	}

	Class Search

	{

	Public boolean isPresent(int target)

	{

	//Complete code here

	}

	}

2)	Copy all elements of one array into another array:

	Problem: We're given an array, and we need to create a new array that contains all the elements of the original array.

	Approach: We will iterate through the given array and copy each element to the new array at the same index. The new array will be of the same size as the original array.

	Boiler Plate Code

	Class CopyArray

	{

	//main method and rest of the code.

	}

3)	Calculate the sum of all elements in an integer array:

	Problem: We're given an array of integers, and we want to find the sum of all its elements.

	Approach: We will iterate through the array and add each element to a "sum" variable. 
	
	By the time we've looked at every element in the array, our "sum" variable will contain the total sum of all elements in the array.

4)	Merge elements of 2 arrays into a 3rd array:

	Problem: We have two arrays, and we want to combine them into a third array.

	Approach: We will create a third array that has a size equal to the sum of the sizes of the first two arrays.

	We'll then copy all elements from the first array to the third array, 

	and then continue where we left off by copying all elements from the second array to the third array.

5)	Calculate the sum of corresponding elements of an array and store in a 3rd array:

	Problem: We're given two arrays of the same size, and we want to create a third array such that each element in this array is the sum of the corresponding elements in the first two arrays.

	Approach: We will create a third array that is the same size as the first two arrays. We'll then go through a for loop where we add the corresponding elements of the first two arrays
	
	and store the result in the third array.
