1)LengthChecker:
  Write a java program to take 2 strings as user input and checks whether they are of same length or not. 
  If the strings are of same length then print “Both strings are of same length” otherwise prints “Both strings are of different length”.

6)Remove Duplicates from a String

Removing Duplicate Characters from a String

Problem Statement:Imagine you are working on a text processing system that needs to remove any redundant characters from given text strings. 

This feature will be used to create cleaner text for documents, emails, and user input. 

Write a function that takes a string and returns a new string with all duplicate characters removed, preserving only the first occurrence of each character.

Sample Input 1:"programming"

Sample Output 1:"progamin"

Sample Input 2:"apple"

Sample Output 2:"aple"

Question Elaborated Explanation:

Removing duplicates from a string is a common operation in text processing applications, like search engines, data cleaning, and document formatting. This task involves scanning a string and removing any character that has been seen before,

 preserving the original order of the characters.

7)Replace Space with 99

Question Topic:String Manipulation - Replacing Characters

Problem Statement:A new data format requires you to write a method that replaces all spaces in a given string with the characters "99." 

This transformation will make the text compatible with a specific parsing system.

Sample Input 1:"Welcome to the future"

Sample Output 1:"Welcome99to99the99future"

Sample Input 2:"Open AI rocks"

Sample Output 2:"Open99AI99rocks"

Question Elaborated Explanation:The task here is to replace all spaces in the given input string with the characters "99." 

This transformation is common in systems where spaces are used as delimiters, 

and an alternative representation is required to handle spaces within the actual data.

8)Display All Substrings of a Given String

Question Topic:

String Manipulation - Displaying Substrings

Problem Statement:

You are creating a tool for a text processing application that requires displaying all possible substrings of a given input string.

Your task is to write a function that takes an input string and prints all its substrings.

Sample Input 1:"abc"

Sample Output 1:a, b, c, ab, bc, abc

Sample Input 2:"AI"

Sample Output 2:A, I, AI

Question Elaborated Explanation:

A substring is a contiguous sequence of characters within a string. For a given string of length n, there are n(n+1)/2 substrings. 

Your task is to display all these substrings.
